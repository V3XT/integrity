title: Wounds
---
Whenever a character is dealt damage, they gain a Wound with a Burden equal to the damage. Wounds often have unique negative effects, with larger wounds having worse penalties.

When a character rests for 8 hours, they can attempt to recover their wounds. For each Wound, roll 2d6. If the result is 10 or greater, mark the Wound. If a Wound has a number of marks equal to its Burden, reduce its Burden by 1 and clear its marks. If a Wound's Burden is reduced to 0, the Wound is healed, and is removed. 

Resting in better locations, such as a safe inn or under the care of a trained physician may improve the odds of the recovery roll above.

The negative effects of Wounds can be mitigated or removed entirely with some items. This is at GM discretion. Bandages could stop bleeding, a crutch could reduce the negative effects of a leg wound.
