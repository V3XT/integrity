---

Time is tracked abstractly at different scales as needed. 


### Beat
This is the shortest unit of time, representing the beat of a heart. Use this scale when every second counts. This makes use of [[initiative]].

### Turns
This represents about 10 minutes. It's most often used when exploring dungeons and other dangerous locations.

#### Breather
A breather is a [[#Turns|Turn]] spent resting.

### Watch
This is a period of 4 hours. Spending a watch in a safe location resting can remove common negative [[conditions]].
