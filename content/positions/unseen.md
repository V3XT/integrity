title: Unseen
---
Characters can be unseen for a variety of reasons. Most commonly, they could be hidden, concealed by darkness, or by magic.

Characters add 1 die to attacks made while unseen.
Characters remove 2 dice when attacking an unseen character in the same zone.
Unseen characters in other zones cannot be attacked.

*If two characters can't see each other, the first and second effects will both apply, resulting in a net 1 die penalty when attacking each other.*
