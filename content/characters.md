Characters represent anything in the fiction that's able to make decisions that affect the world. This includes both the player's characters, and any NPCs controlled by the GM.

Character's have three primary attributes, Knack, Might, and Will. They're rated from -5 to +5. Whenever a character makes a [[tests|test]], they will add or remove a number of dice based on the attribute being tested. 

**Knack -** Cunning and talent. These characters are clever, and fast. They are more adaptable than others. In other systems this may be called dexterity, guile, intelligence, or agility.

**Might -** Physical prowess. Mighty characters are strong, and hardy. They can take more hits than others. In other systems this may be called strength, fortitude, endurance, constitution, or brawn.

**Will -** Mental fortitude. Willful characters are determined, and resilient. They use magic better than others. In other systems this may be called wisdom, or charisma.
