title: Zones
---
Zones are used to track where characters are during combat or local exploration. They also determine the range of spells and ranged weapons.

A **zone** is an abstraction of space. It's often a single room, though in large rooms or open areas, a zone is about 10m across. 

During _turns_ if characters are thoroughly searching each room, every zone will take 10 minutes. If they are moving without searching they can either move cautiously at a rate of 4 zones per turn, or recklessly at a rate of 20 zones per turn. While moving cautiously, characters are less likely to be detected, and will automatically notice threats that aren't disguised. While moving recklessly, characters will automatically trigger traps they aren't aware of, and are likely to be detected. Moving recklessly should typically only be done during dire circumstances, or in areas that are known to be safe.

Zones can have **features** which may add additional rules. The GM determines which features are present in a zone and how they work. Here are some common features and affects.

- Rugged - uneven terrain makes moving more difficult. Moving into or out of this zone costs 1 extra initiative point.
- Tight - a thin corridor or low ceiling makes this area is cramped. Attacks are at disadvantage.
- Threshold - a door or other obstacle restricts movement between this zone and another. Creatures can guard a threshold in an attempt to prevent others from moving through it.
- Cover - physical obstacles in this zone provide cover from creatures in other zones, which gives advantage to hiding, and disadvantage to ranged attacks.
