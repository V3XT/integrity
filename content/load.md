title: Load
---
A character's Load is used to simplify tracking many different statuses. It allows several systems to work together in simple ways. Each character has a **Load** of 8 + 2 * Might. Load is more than just the number of things someone can carry. It also represents how many wounds they can suffer before going down, and how much magic they can contain.

The following things are a burden to carry. Unless otherwise noted, they provide one burden.

Items - Any equipment, weapons, or gear. Unwieldy items, such as a heavy chest, or large painting may have additional burden at GM discretion. Small items, like keys or gems can be bundled in a reasonable container and treated as a single burden.

[[spells]] - Controlling a spell requires binding it to you. Though ethereal in nature, this still provides a burden.

[[conditions]] - 

If a character's burden is greater than their load, they are overloaded and suffer a penalty to any [[tests]] they make equal to the difference. (Ex. Grom has 1 Might so his Load is 10. If his burden is 12, he subtracts 2 dice from all tests he makes.)

If a character's burden from Wounds and Exhaustion combined is greater than their Load, they are broken and unable to act. If that burden is greater than their Limit, they die.
